<p>The first chapter of Italo Calvino's <em>If on a winter's night a traveler</em>, a lovely meditation on reading, describes many types of books. I first read this list in September 2013 and "Inexplicable Curiosity, Not Easily Justified" has been lodged deeply into my brain ever since.  If nothing else, this site is a collection of curiosities, without offer or expectation of justification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sections in the bookstore</p>
<ul>
<li>Books You Haven't Read</li>
<li>Books You Needn't Read</li>
<li>Books Made for Purposes Other Than Reading</li>
<li>Books Read Even Before You Open Them Since They Belong to the Category of Books Read Before Being Written</li>
<li>Books That If You Had More Than One Life You Would Certainly Also Read But Unfortunately Your Days Are Numbered</li>
<li>Books You Mean to Read But There Are Others You Must Read First</li>
<li>Books Too Expensive Now and You'll Wait 'Til They're Remaindered</li>
<li>Books ditto When They Come Out in Paperback</li>
<li>Books You Can Borrow from Somebody</li>
<li>Books That Everybody's Read So It's As If You Had Read Them, Too</li>
<li>Books You've Been Planning to Read for Ages</li>
<li>Books You've Been Hunting for Years Without Success</li>
<li>Books Dealing with Something You're Working on at the Moment</li>
<li>Books You Want to Own So They'll Be Handy Just in Case</li>
<li>Books You Could Put Aside Maybe to Read This Summer</li>
<li>Books You Need to Go with Other Books on Your Shelves</li>
<li><strong><u>Books That Fill You with Sudden, Inexplicable Curiosity, Not Easily Justified</u></strong></li>
<li>Books Read Long Ago Which It's Now Time to Re-read</li>
<li>Books You've Always Pretended to Have Read and Now It's Time to Sit Down and Really Read Them</li>
</ul>
