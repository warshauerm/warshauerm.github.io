    <h1></h1>
<p>The other day I was reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780804137317">Boom Town</a>, Sam Anderson's "Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, Its Chaotic Founding... Its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-class Metropolis." In addition to learning all about tornadoes, Kevin Durant, civil rights pioneer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Luper">Clara Luper</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rush_of_1889">founding land rush</a>, and more, I discovered that the city's bike share program is known as <strong>Spokies</strong>. This lovely portmanteau (wheel spoke + Okies) raised a critical question: <strong>What bike share system has the best name?</strong></p>
<p>I couldn't find a great directory of programs, so I made my own by looking at the top 100 American cities by population. I'm sure there are great bike share program names in other cities and countries, but, unfortunately, I had to draw the line somewhere (see Notes/Methods for details).</p>
<p>Before I get to the main list, there are two special categories and an honorable mention.</p>
<h3>Go, Go, GO!</h3>
<p>Four cities use an xGo convention that I quite like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Ranking</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">4th</td>
<td><strong>CoGo</strong></td>
<td>Colombus, OH</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">3rd</td>
<td><strong>TuGo</strong></td>
<td>Tuscon, AZ</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">2nd</td>
<td><strong>MoGo</strong></td>
<td>Detroit, MI</td>
<td>Nice nod to Motor City is enough for 2nd in this category.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">1st</td>
<td><strong>ToleGO</strong></td>
<td>Toledo, OH</td>
<td>Such a smooth integration of GO into the name of the city deserves 1st.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Colorful Communities</h3>
<p>Four cities use a color to identify their bike share system:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Ranking</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>4th</td>
<td><strong>Bluebikes</strong></td>
<td>Boston, MA</td>
<td>Blue from Blue Cross Blue Shield, the naming sponsor; this is in last place instead of tied with New Orleans because I really liked the old name: Hubway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3rd</td>
<td><strong>Blue Bikes</strong></td>
<td>New Orleans, LA</td>
<td>Blue from a similar sponsorship with Blue Cross Blue Shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1st (tie)</td>
<td><strong>Red Bikes</strong> and <strong>Green Bikes</strong></td>
<td>Cincinnati, OH and Boise, ID</td>
<td>Two unsponsored names, good color choices, a tie for 1st.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Honorable Mention</h3>
<p>Though well outside the top 100, I came across Lexington, MA's <strong>Minuteman Bike Share</strong>. Great name with an excellent nod to local history. More cities should learn from Lexington.</p>
<h2>Power Rankings - Top 10!</h2>
<p>Now to the main, extremely scientific, event. It was hard fought and there were some solid (and many boring) names left on the floor. I'm proud to present the best Bike Share system names:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Ranking</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10th</td>
<td><strong>Nice Ride Minnesota</strong></td>
<td>Minneapolis, MN</td>
<td>A nice extension on the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_nice">Minnesota Nice</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9th</td>
<td><strong>Heartland BCycle</strong></td>
<td>Omaha, NE</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCycle">BCycle</a> is a company that operates dozens of bike share systems around the US. Some have great names (and appear on this list). Most of them are called "City Name Bcycle." I applaud Omaha for having some fun with that convention and not using their City Name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8th</td>
<td><strong>Bay Wheels</strong></td>
<td>San Francisco Bay Area, CA</td>
<td>A positive step forward for a system formerly known as "Ford GoBikes."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7th</td>
<td><strong>CaBi (Capital Bikeshare)</strong></td>
<td>Washington, D.C.</td>
<td>CaBi is fun to say and reminds you of your presence in the Capital city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6th</td>
<td><strong>Bublr Bikes</strong></td>
<td>Milwaukee, WI</td>
<td>I can't figure out why this system is called Bublr but I like it. It's cheery and memorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5th</td>
<td><strong>Biki</strong></td>
<td>Honolulu, HI</td>
<td>How can you not love a program that has a Bikipedia (FAQ) and a press site called Biki Leaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4th</td>
<td><strong>Pike Ride</strong></td>
<td>Colorado Springs, CO</td>
<td>Referencing nearby Pike's Peak and it sounds like "bike ride," what could be better?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Well, I guess these champions can be better!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Ranking</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3rd</td>
<td><strong>This Machine</strong></td>
<td>Tulsa, NE</td>
<td>No clue why Tulsa calls their bike share system by this name, but it is intense and I dig it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2nd</td>
<td><strong>LouVelo</strong></td>
<td>Louisville, KY</td>
<td>Velo is the French word for bike (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velodrome">Velodrome</a>) and it fits so well with Louisville. A+!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1st</td>
<td><strong>Spokies</strong></td>
<td>Oklahoma City, OK</td>
<td>I was inspired to this project after learning about this name. I went searching to see if any American city could top it. They all came up short. <strong>Spokies is the best bike share system name in the US.</strong></td>
</tr>

<h2></h2>
<p>Bike share programs are excellent, whether they have good names or not they are an incredibly valuable part of the urban fabric. <a href="https://thebicyclerevolution.org/local-bicycle-organizations/">Support your local Bike Coalition and help make your more city more bike-friendly!</a> </p>
<h2>Notes and Methods:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This list is entirely subjective and therefore 100% accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I genenerally considered only city specific programs, even if operated by a multi-city company (vs multi-city companies) with docking stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population">List of cities by population from Wikipedia based on 2018 estimated population</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bike share programs identified through googling. I'm sure I missed some or got some wrong, but I did my best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bike share systems have had multiple names and have closed or might open in the future. I used their names and statuses as best as I could find on Feb. 10, 2020.</p>
